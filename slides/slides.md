1. **Forgiven** in Godly Shame [(v60-63)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (skip over comparison w/Samaria+Sodom)

On the day you were **born** <br>
your cord was not **cut**, <br>
nor were you **washed** with water to cleanse you

[5](# "ref")
No eye **pitied** you, to do any of these things  <br>
to you out of **compassion** for you,

but you were **cast out** on the open field

[Ezekiel 16:4,5 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **default** condition of mankind:
+ **helpless**, dependent
  + try to **build** happy life for self
  + but **fail** completely
+ no one has **pity** / mercy
  + Hosea: **Lo-Ruhamah**, not having received compassion
+ "cast out": **unwanted** baby
  + for you were **abhorred**
+ blood/muck: **failures**, selfishness, anger, lust
  + others **see** only our character **flaws**
  + and **despise** us for them
+ what did **God** see?

---
And when I passed by you <br>
and saw you **wallowing** in your blood,

I said to you in your blood, ‘**Live!**’<br>
I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’

[Ezekiel 16:6 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ "wallow": kick, **trample**
  + we too **hate** our own flaws
  + but futile, kicking in blood
+ God **adopted** us, washed, gave us **life**
+ grew + **flourished** like plant

---
You were **adorned** with gold and silver, <br>
You grew exceedingly **beautiful** <br>
and advanced to **royalty**.

[14](# "ref")
Your **renown** went forth among the nations <br>
because of your **beauty**,

for it was perfect through the **splendor** <br>
that I had **bestowed** on you

[Ezekiel 16:13-14 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ blessings from God: **home**, family, stability, recognition
  + virtues: **patience**, generosity, hospit
+ all these were **bestowed** by God
  + not **earned** by own efforts
+ **princess**: bc of our Father

# Have I mistaken God's **grace** for God's **approval**?

>>>
+ yes, we are richly **blessed**
+ **not** bc God approves of our behaviour!

But you **trusted** in your beauty <br>
and played the **harlot** because of your fame

[17](# "ref")
You also took your beautiful **jewels** <br>
made of **My gold** and of My silver, <br>
which I had **given** you,

and made for yourself male **images** <br>
that you might play the harlot with them.

[Ezekiel 16:15,17 (NASB)](# "ref")

>>>

  + **house**, garden, wife, kids
  + kids doing well in **school**
  + on-track to good **career**, work-life
  + always **hospitable**, generous

+ pursue **gift** rather than giver
+ **harlot**: exchange priceless **treasure** for base **gain**
  + treasure is **not** the blessings
  + but our **purity** / holiness
+ not only impacts **selves**,
  + also the next **generation**:

---
You slaughtered **My children** <br>
and offered them up to **idols** <br>
by causing them to pass through the **fire**.

[Ezekiel 16:21 (NASB)](# "ref")

>>>
+ kids are **God's** kids, not mine
  + in my **pursuit** of success, happiness
  + I **sacrifice** them
+ **values** / priorities we live by
  + pass on to **children**
+ "just be **happy** and do well in **school**"
  + &rArr; prize **comfort** + success
+ but we don't teach them greatest **prize**:
  + to **know** Christ
  + pure + **childlike** faith
+ some kids will **rebel**
  + see the **hypocrisy**
+ some will **internalise** same values
  + pursue comfort + success

You made your beauty **abominable**, <br>
and you spread your legs to every **passer-by** <br>
to multiply your harlotry.

[25](# "ref")
You also played the harlot with <br>
the **Egyptians**, ... Philistines, <br>
... Assyrians, ... Chaldea, <br>
[29](# "ref")
yet even with this you were not **satisfied**

[Ezekiel 16:25-29 (NASB)](# "ref")

  + feel **needed**
  + deny being **lazy** / dependent
+ crave **affirmation**, recognition
  + **tell** me I'm a **good** person
+ **addiction**: unable to satisfy

Behold, I will gather all your **lovers** <br>
with whom you took pleasure,

even all those whom you **loved** <br>
and all those whom you **hated**.

So I will gather them **against** you <br>
from every direction <br>
and **expose** your nakedness to them

[Ezekiel 16:37 (NASB)](# "ref")

  + perfect **house** / cake / kids' clothes
  + those we thought were our **friends**
  + even our own **parents**
+ some we **love**, some we **hate**

  + strip away clothes, jewels
  + reveal how **broken** we truly are
+ v39-41 when they **see** us as we are
  + **take** what they can from us
  + **cut** to pieces, burn houses

When I kept **silent**, my bones **wasted away** <br>
through my groaning all day long.

I **acknowledged** my sin to you, <br>
and I did not **cover** my iniquity;

I said, “I will **confess** <br>
my transgressions to the Lord,” <br>
and you **forgave** the iniquity of my sin.

[Psalm 32:3,5 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
