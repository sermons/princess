On the day you were **born** your cord was not **cut**, <br>
nor were you **washed** with water to cleanse you

No eye **pitied** you, to do any of these things  <br>
to you out of **compassion** for you,

but you were **cast out** on the open field,  <br>
for you were **abhorred**,  <br>
on the day that you were born.

And when I passed by you <br>
and saw you **wallowing** in your blood, <br>
I said to you in your blood, ‘**Live!**’<br>
I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’

And you grew up and became tall <br>
