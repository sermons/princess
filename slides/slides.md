“Son of man, confront Jerusalem <br>

‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Jerusalem: 

Your ancestry and birth <br>
were in the land of the Canaanites; <br>
your father was an Amorite <br>
and your mother a Hittite.

your cord was not cut,

nor were you washed with water  <br>
to make you clean,

nor were you rubbed with salt  <br>
or wrapped in cloths.

No one looked on you with pity  <br>

Rather, you were thrown out <br>
